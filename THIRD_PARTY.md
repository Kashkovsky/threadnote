# Third-party software

Threadnote 4 is a self-contained application with an embedded Bun runtime. It does not install or invoke Node.js,
Python, OpenViking, or a separate memory server.

## Runtime and bundled software

Direct runtime software and packages bundled into the published JavaScript retain their own licenses:

Grammar and parser license copies, source revisions, ABIs, and SHA-256 checksums are included under
`assets/code-graph/`. Consult those files and each installed package's metadata for the authoritative terms. The
pinned MIT-licensed BGE Small embedding model is embedded in the standalone executable and installed automatically by
`threadnote install`; other model files require an explicit `threadnote models install` action. Catalog entries identify
every model source and license. The complete upstream BGE/FlagEmbedding MIT notice is included in release archives at
`assets/models/licenses/bge-small-en-v1.5.LICENSE`.

## Public website

The separately deployed GitHub Pages website is not part of the standalone release. Its build uses Vite and
`@vitejs/plugin-react` (MIT). Release social cards are rendered during the website build with `@resvg/resvg-js` 2.6.2
(MIT) and Spline Sans from `@expo-google-fonts/spline-sans` 0.4.2 (MIT package, SIL Open Font License 1.1 font). The
website also self-hosts Spline Sans and JetBrains Mono through Fontsource packages. The font packages and font files
are distributed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. A copy is included with the website assets.

## Historical migration compatibility

Threadnote 4 can read a legacy `~/.openviking` directory during the explicit, non-destructive home migration. That
compatibility path copies user-owned data into `~/.threadnote`, excludes old runtime artifacts, and never executes or
bundles OpenViking code. OpenViking is not a Threadnote 4 runtime dependency.
