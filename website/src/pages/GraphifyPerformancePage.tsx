          Both observations used the same Apple M1 Max, 64 GiB memory, internal APFS SSD, and fixture commit. Graphify

          four workers (SHA-256 <code>3d8edfd8…</code>), but its bound benchmark artifact does not serialize that field.
          Threadnote used Bun 1.3.14; the Graphify package <code>graphifyy</code> 0.9.49 used Python 3.12.5. Its exact
