# Telemetry production runbook

This runbook gates the public `telemetry.threadnote.io` destination. Do not map
DNS or release a build using the default endpoint until every preflight item is
recorded and the storage canary has succeeded.

## Production record

Keep this section current without placing token values in the repository.

Production policy is an EU Grafana Cloud stack with the shortest available
trace retention. Grafana currently documents a 14-day minimum for Free and a
30-day minimum for paid accounts. Verify the configured value and region in the
Grafana Cloud portal; endpoint naming is only a hint, not proof of either.
Fly's searchable application logs currently retain seven days.
Threadnote emits no access logs and only fixed operational error codes and
Collector warnings. Do not add payloads, headers, source addresses, session IDs,
or trace IDs to stdout/stderr. Fly Proxy necessarily observes the transport IP
and adds `Fly-Client-IP`; the gateway uses it only in an in-memory, per-process
HMAC rate key and never forwards it. Record the Fly/Grafana DPAs, subprocessors,
support confirmation about transport-log retention, and the privacy-policy
owner's approval before launch.

## Free-plan and ingestion budget

Production must remain on Grafana Cloud **Free**, not a Pro trial or paid plan.
Before DNS and every release, confirm the organization and stack both show
Free/Always free at $0 with no credit card, 14-day trace retention, and the
current 50 GB monthly trace-ingestion limit. Free is a hard product boundary:
do not add a payment method, accept a Pro trial or upgrade, increase retention,
or enable a paid feature for this service. If the account or stack ever shows
Pro or a payment method, disable public ingestion immediately and resolve the
account state before resuming.

The gateway independently caps accepted canonical protobuf at 32 KiB per
minute per Machine and 16 KiB per Fly-identified source. One public source
therefore cannot consume the whole Machine allowance; multiple-source abuse
remains bounded by the global limit. The reviewed upper bound is exactly
`32768 × 2 × 31 × 24 × 60 = 2,925,527,040` canonical bytes per 31 days. The
Collector queue and retry loop are disabled, so it makes one best-effort export
attempt per accepted batch rather than intentionally amplifying that volume.
Grafana's provider-side accounting remains authoritative and can differ from
canonical wire bytes, which is why the first operator gate is still more than
three times the gateway ceiling.

This anonymous public feed is diagnostic evidence, not a security, audit, or
billing record. Schema-valid public spans are untrusted. The per-source limit
uses Fly Proxy's client-IP boundary only for ephemeral abuse containment; the
gateway HMACs the address with a process-random key and never logs or exports
it. Keep `telemetry.threadnote.io` DNS-only to Fly. Do not place a shared-egress
reverse proxy in front of Fly without redesigning the source limit.

Keep the live Fly inventory at exactly two started Machines. The scheduled
storage canary reads the real Machine inventory with a read-only Fly token and
fails before sending telemetry if the count or state drifts. Scaling out,
weakening the byte cap, enabling Collector retries/queues, adding another
signal, or sharing the stack requires a reviewed budget change before
deployment. CI keeps the per-Machine cap, two-Machine inventory, 31-day
accounting period, 3 GB internal ceiling, and 10/20/50 GB gates ordered.

In **Cost Management and Billing > Usage Alerts**, create a global **Traces**
usage alert with a 20 GB monthly threshold and custom alert levels at 50% and
100%, yielding notifications at 10 GB and 20 GB. Route both to the named service
owner and backup, test the contact point, and record the rule IDs and test date.
Also monitor `grafanacloud_traces_instance_usage`,
`grafanacloud_traces_instance_bytes_received_per_second`, and discarded spans
from the `grafanacloud-usage` data source. These alerts are safety gates, never
permission to upgrade:

- **10 GB:** acknowledge the alert the same day; verify the stack is still Free
  with 14-day retention, run the live Machine-budget check, identify any shared
  or unexpected signal usage, and deploy a reviewed lower gateway cap. Do not
  increase the Grafana limit or move to Pro.
- **20 GB:** immediately stop public trace ingestion while keeping `/healthz`
  available:

  ```sh
  fly secrets set THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_PUBLIC_INGESTION=disabled \
    --app threadnote-telemetry
  curl --output /dev/null --silent --write-out '%{http_code}\n' \
    --request POST --header 'Content-Type: application/x-protobuf' \
    --data-binary '' https://threadnote-telemetry.fly.dev/v1/traces
  ```

  The POST must return `503`; the storage canary and heartbeat will then fail by
  design and the incident must be acknowledged. Resume only after the provider
  allowance window resets, the cause is fixed, the owner approves, and a
  preflight canary succeeds. Restore the checked-in `enabled` value and restart
  the Machines with:

  ```sh
  fly secrets unset THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_PUBLIC_INGESTION \
    --app threadnote-telemetry
  ```

  Never resume by upgrading the Grafana plan.

## Credentials and rotation

Use six distinct identities:

1. `threadnote-telemetry-ingest` is single-stack and `traces:write` only. Its
   exact OTLP base URL becomes the Fly secret `GRAFANA_CLOUD_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.
   Its numeric instance ID and token become the Fly secret
   `GRAFANA_CLOUD_AUTHORIZATION` in the form
   `Basic <base64(instance-id:write-token)>`. It cannot read traces.
2. `threadnote-telemetry-canary-read` is single-stack and `traces:read` only.
   Store its numeric Tempo **User**, token, and exact Tempo data-source URL as
   protected `telemetry-production` GitHub Environment secrets:
   `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_CANARY_TEMPO_USER`,
   `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_CANARY_TEMPO_TOKEN`, and
   `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_CANARY_TEMPO_URL`. The URL ends in `/tempo`; it is not
   the OTLP gateway or Grafana UI URL.
3. The secret `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_CANARY_HEARTBEAT_URL` is the endpoint of a
   dedicated Grafana IRM Webhook integration with Heartbeat enabled. Treat the
   endpoint as a credential and expose it only to the canary job.
4. `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_CANARY_FLY_READ_TOKEN` is a short-lived, read-only Fly
   organization token used only to list the live Machine inventory. Create it
   with `fly tokens create readonly`, use the shortest practical expiry (30
   days or less), store it in the protected `telemetry-production` GitHub
   Environment, and rotate it before expiry. Never use a personal or deploy
   token for the scheduled canary.
   Set the non-secret `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_CANARY_GATEWAY_URL` Environment
   variable to the exact `.fly.dev/v1/traces` preflight URL until DNS and TLS
   are live. Change it to `https://telemetry.threadnote.io/v1/traces` during
   the hostname cutover; manual workflow dispatch input overrides this value.
5. `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_FLY_DEPLOY_TOKEN` is an app-scoped Fly deploy token
   used only by the `telemetry-production-deploy` GitHub Environment. Create it
   with a short explicit expiry, for example:

   ```sh
   fly tokens create deploy --app threadnote-telemetry --expiry 720h \
     --name threadnote-github-production
   ```

   Store the result as an Environment secret without printing it again. Allow
   only `main` to deploy, require the service owner to review deployments, and
   disallow administrator bypass where the repository plan supports it. The
   deploy Environment must not contain Tempo read or heartbeat credentials.

6. Dashboard/alert provisioning, when automated, uses a separate Grafana
   service account restricted to the required dashboard and alert resources.

Do not add the deploy token or merge a runtime input until every control below
is active:

1. The default-branch Repository Ruleset requires a pull request, one approval,
   code-owner review, signed commits, and linear history. Remove or narrow any
   always-bypass repository role; an administrator bypass defeats workflow
   ownership.
2. `CODEOWNERS` owns itself, both telemetry workflows, the gateway deployment
   classifier, `fly.toml`, `.dockerignore`, and every gateway runtime input.
3. After its first tokenless run makes the check name selectable, add
   **Gateway checks complete** as a required status check in the Ruleset.
4. Create `telemetry-production-deploy`, admit only `main`, add the required
   service-owner reviewer, and only then store
   `THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_FLY_DEPLOY_TOKEN`. Do not rely on GitHub implicitly
   creating an unprotected Environment from the workflow reference.

The read-only `telemetry-production` Environment intentionally has no human
reviewer because its scheduled canary must run unattended. Its main-only branch
rule, workflow ownership, and non-bypassable Repository Ruleset are therefore
the protection boundary for Tempo, heartbeat, and Fly read credentials.

Rotate without an ingestion gap:

1. Create a replacement token on the same least-privilege policy. Keep the old
   token active.
2. Update only the relevant Fly or GitHub Environment secret. Never echo a
   token or build a Basic header in shell output.
3. Deploy/restart when rotating Fly ingest auth, then run the storage canary.
   For read auth, dispatch the canary directly after updating the secret.
4. Confirm all thirteen stored canary traces and normal exporter logs, then
   revoke the old token. Record policy/token IDs and dates, not values.
5. A failed canary blocks revocation and release. Restore the old secret while
   it remains valid and investigate.

## Storage canary and alert

[`telemetry-delivery-canary.yml`](../../.github/workflows/telemetry-delivery-canary.yml)
runs every 15 minutes and on demand. It first pipes `flyctl machine list --json`
into the budget verifier; no Machine identifiers are logged. It then generates
thirteen random, schema-valid, content-free traces: one frozen schema-v1 completion;
one complete schema-v2 terminal graph-build lifecycle; equivalent schema-v3 and
schema-v4 graph lifecycles; schema-v3 and schema-v4 automatic-update worker
completions; one schema-v4 graph-query status checkpoint; and one schema-v4
graph-query completion carrying the execute-inherited snapshot surface; plus four
schema-v5 Context Brief phase checkpoints and one schema-v5 Context Brief
completion carrying its full successful citation-quality surface. It posts
each through the public gateway and polls Grafana Tempo by the exact trace IDs
until all thirteen stored protobufs contain the expected version-specific resource
and span identity. The synthetic version is `0.0.0-canary`, making it filterable
from product telemetry and explicitly excluded by every operated dashboard
query. Success proves the two-Machine budget, public TLS, five-version route and
schema validation, Collector export, Grafana ingestion, storage, read credentials,
and query availability. `/healthz` proves none of the storage/read path.

The exact query contract is:

```text
GET <TEMPO_URL>/api/v2/traces/<32-lowercase-hex-trace-id>?start=<unix-seconds>&end=<unix-seconds>
Accept: application/protobuf
Authorization: Basic base64(<numeric Tempo User>:<traces:read token>)
```

Tempo `404` means not visible yet and is retried for 60 seconds. Other non-200
responses, a wrong trace, malformed protobuf, or timeout fail immediately. The
canary never prints credentials, trace/session IDs, response bodies, or URLs.

Protect the `telemetry-production` GitHub Environment with a default-branch
deployment rule. GitHub does not workflow-allowlist Environment secrets, so the
Ruleset and `CODEOWNERS` controls above must protect every workflow change. Do
not require a human approval on scheduled jobs. Its validation and canary jobs
set `deployment: false`, so reads do not create GitHub deployment records.
Enable Actions failure notifications to the service owner.

In Grafana IRM, create a dedicated Webhook integration named
`threadnote-telemetry-canary`, configure its escalation route, enable Heartbeat
with a 30-minute interval, and store its endpoint as
`THREADNOTE_TELEMETRY_CANARY_HEARTBEAT_URL`. The workflow pings it only after a
trace is stored and verified. Missing secrets, rejected traces, query failures,
disabled schedules, and GitHub incidents therefore all become a missed
heartbeat and an IRM alert. Test both firing and resolution by temporarily
using a one-minute heartbeat interval, withholding a success, acknowledging
the alert, restoring 30 minutes, and dispatching a successful run. Do not rely
on a Tempo Grafana-managed alert: Grafana documents the Tempo data source as
not supporting alerting.

## Availability and deployment

Production requires two always-running, stateless Machines before DNS. Two
Machines in `fra` cover host and rolling-deploy failure; place one in a second
approved EU region if the availability objective includes a regional outage.
Keep the Collector backend in its confirmed EU region. Service-level `/healthz`
checks must gate Fly routing and deployments, and deployments must be rolling
or canary with at most one unavailable Machine. A health check must have its
own trusted capacity path; it must not consume public per-source or global
ingestion budget, and a path-only public bypass is forbidden.

[`telemetry-gateway.yml`](../../.github/workflows/telemetry-gateway.yml) emits an
always-present terminal check. Pull requests validate without credentials.
Merges to `main` deploy only when the Docker build context, Fly configuration,
Collector configuration, gateway runtime (including its shared internal budget
constants), dependencies, or admitted schemas change. Dashboard,
documentation, test-only, standalone budget-verifier command, storage-canary,
and workflow-only changes are validated but cannot start a production rollout.
When a workflow-only rollout-gate fix itself must be proven, dispatch
`telemetry-gateway.yml` from the exact `main` revision with
`redeploy_production=true`. That explicit run uses the protected production
environment, redeploys an immutable image for the selected revision, and must
pass the same post-deploy convergence and storage-canary gates; the default
manual dispatch remains validation-only.

The production job first rejects a superseded revision when newer `main` commits
change a production input. Later workflow, classifier, documentation, or
test-only commits do not strand an otherwise-current reviewed runtime rollout
and cannot deploy by themselves. The job then requires one shared prior image,
exactly two started Machines, and two passing service health checks. It builds
and smokes one image, pushes that image once, resolves its registry digest, and
gives that immutable digest to `fly deploy`. Rollouts are serialized without
cancellation and use the checked-in canary strategy with at most one unavailable
Machine. The deploy is update-only, so unexpected process-group drift cannot
create additional Machines. A successful rollout must end with exactly two
healthy Machines running the reviewed digest, healthy production and canonical
Fly endpoints, and all thirteen stored canaries: the frozen-v1 completion; v2, v3,
and v4 terminal graph builds; v3 and v4 automatic-update completions; and the v4
graph-query status checkpoint and execute-inherited completion; plus all four v5
Context Brief phase checkpoints and the complete v5 terminal result. The rollout queue
retains up to 100 pending `main` runs so a later non-runtime workflow cannot
displace a queued deployment. The separately serialized scheduled canary
boundedly retries its exact two-Machine check while Fly may be replacing a
canary Machine; persistent drift still fails before it sends telemetry or
records a heartbeat.

An in-flight rollout continues under the reviewed workflow revision that
started it. When a workflow or classifier security fix must stop that rollout,
an operator must cancel it explicitly before merging the fix; a later
validation-only commit deliberately does not cancel production work.

Equivalent operator pre-deploy evidence is:

```sh
go test ./...
docker build --pull --file infra/telemetry-gateway/Dockerfile \
  --tag threadnote-telemetry-gateway:release .
fly config validate --config fly.toml
fly machine list --app threadnote-telemetry --json | \
  go -C infra/telemetry-gateway run ./cmd/budget
fly checks list --app threadnote-telemetry
```

The workflow fails rather than silently repairing production drift. Do not make
a single-Machine production exception: it creates avoidable downtime for host
failure and deploys. If one Machine is temporarily lost, an operator must
diagnose it and restore count two before retrying any deployment or credential
rotation.

The workflow deliberately does not roll back automatically. A storage canary
can fail because Tempo or its read path is unavailable even when the new gateway
is healthy; blindly changing the gateway image would hide that distinction. On
failure, diagnose first, then use the previous immutable image recorded in the
workflow summary and follow the rollback procedure below.

For a telemetry schema rollout, deployment order is a hard compatibility gate.
Schemas v1, v2, v3, and v4 are immutable; v5 is additive and does not redefine
any older contract:

1. Deploy the gateway/Collector revision that accepts frozen schemas v1 through
   v4 plus the new immutable schema v5. Do not release a v5 producer yet.
2. Dispatch the production storage canary and require the frozen v1 completion;
   v2/v3/v4 graph and automatic-update compatibility surfaces; both v4 graph-query
   traces; all four v5 Context Brief phase checkpoints; and the complete v5 Context
   Brief completion to be accepted, stored, and queryable.
3. Deploy the dashboard revision. Verify that generic panels admit v1/v2/v3/v4/v5,
   graph-build panels admit v2/v3/v4/v5, automatic-update panels admit v3/v4/v5,
   graph-query panels select v4/v5, and Context Brief panels select v5 only.
   Exercise the new panels against all five stored synthetic v5 Context Brief traces.
4. Only after the gateway, thirteen-trace/five-version canary, and dashboard gates
   pass, release the consent-v5 producer. Existing consent-v1/v2/v3/v4 configurations
   must fail closed until the user reviews and explicitly reapplies consent; never
   migrate opt-in silently.
5. Keep v1/v2/v3/v4 ingress and canary coverage until every supported older producer
   is retired in a separately reviewed schema-removal change.

A v5 canary rejection or an unvalidated dashboard blocks the producer release
even when `/healthz` and the v1/v2/v3/v4 canaries pass. If a producer was released
out of order, roll it back before debugging the gateway; telemetry remains
best-effort and must not drive an unsafe compatibility exception.

## DNS and TLS launch checklist

1. Lower the existing DNS TTL one retention window before launch. Confirm no
   conflicting A, AAAA, or CNAME records.
2. Add the hostname to Fly and copy the records Fly actually reports:

   ```sh
   fly certs add telemetry.threadnote.io --app threadnote-telemetry
   fly certs setup telemetry.threadnote.io --app threadnote-telemetry
   ```

3. Create the exact CNAME and any `_fly-ownership`/ACME record shown by Fly.
   Do not infer the target from an example.
4. Wait for DNS propagation and a valid Fly-managed certificate:

   ```sh
   fly certs check telemetry.threadnote.io --app threadnote-telemetry
   curl --fail --silent --show-error https://telemetry.threadnote.io/healthz
   ```

5. Before DNS, dispatch the storage canary with
   `https://threadnote-telemetry.fly.dev/v1/traces`; only this preflight host and
   the production host are admitted. After DNS and certificate issuance,
   dispatch it again against the default public hostname and require success.
6. Test TLS from two networks, wrong routes/methods/content types, rate limits,
   and opt-in CLI plus isolated MCP flows. Confirm the Grafana trace contains
   only the documented schema and exact app version.
7. Confirm dashboard access is private, alert/dead-man notifications arrive,
   retention/region records are complete, and two healthy Machines are live.
8. Release progressively and watch the canary, Fly state/logs, Grafana discard
   metrics, request rate, and trace volume. Restore normal DNS TTL only after
   the observation window.

## Incident response and rollback

First distinguish the failing segment: public DNS/TLS and `/healthz`; Fly
Machine count/state/routing; gateway fixed error codes and Collector warnings;
canary POST status; Tempo query status/visibility; Grafana service status and
discard metrics. Never capture a raw production request or paste credentials,
payloads, trace IDs, or IP addresses into an incident ticket.

For a bad Fly release, retrieve the last known-good image from `fly releases
--image --app threadnote-telemetry`, deploy that immutable image with the same
rolling/maximum-unavailable policy, require two healthy Machines, and rerun the
storage canary. If data safety or privacy is uncertain, disable the public
route or remove the CNAME and publish the telemetry kill switch; telemetry is
best-effort and product operation must continue without it. DNS rollback is
slower than image rollback and remains cached for the active TTL.

After recovery, record timeline, affected path, release/image, canary evidence,
provider status, trace volume, credential action, rollback, and follow-up owner.
Do not increase retention or enable richer logging as an incident shortcut.
